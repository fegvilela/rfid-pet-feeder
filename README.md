# Pet Feeder

This is a project for my cats. Currently, I have 5 smelly felines and two of them need to eat a separate meal, so we need at least three separate pet feeders.

The idea here is that each cat will have a RFID tag on its collar and the pet feeder will open only to the "owner" of that feeder.
